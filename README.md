# Ai-research-companion

## Project Overview

The Ai-research-companion is a cutting-edge tool aimed at revolutionizing how individuals engage with research papers and articles. Our goal is to provide intelligent recommendations and facilitate seamless interactions with academic content. Here's an overview of our project:

### Features

1. **AI-based Article and Research Paper Recommendation:**
   - Users can receive tailored recommendations based on their specified interests, be it keywords, topics, or preferred papers.

2. **Article and Research Paper to Audiobook/Podcast Conversion:**
   - Our tool converts academic content into audiobooks and podcasts for on-the-go learning.

3. **Article and Research Paper to LLM Context Conversion:**
   - Content is translated into a format comprehensible by the LLM, enabling users to ask questions and receive informative answers.

4. **LLM Knowledge Update:**
   - We keep the pre-trained LLM up-to-date with the latest knowledge via web searches, addressing issues of hallucinations and misinformation.

5. **AI-based Research Paper Review:**
   - Users can obtain AI-driven feedback on their research papers to enhance their quality.

### Progress Report

As of now, we have successfully implemented a contextual querying system that allows users to engage with PDFs through a vector database. This lays a solid foundation for the project. However, there is still work in progress for the remaining functionalities.
